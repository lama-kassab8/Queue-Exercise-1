# Customer Service Queue Simulation

This project simulates a basic customer service system using a queue (FIFO â€“ First In, First Out).

## Description

Customers arrive and are added to a queue. Each customer is served in the order they arrive. Once served, they leave the queue.

The program performs the following actions:

- Enqueue customer names as they arrive.
- Dequeue and display the name of each customer as they are served.
- Display a final message when the queue is empty.

## Sample Output
Arriving: Alice
Arriving: Bob
Arriving: Carol
Serving: Alice
Serving: Bob
Serving: Carol
All customers served.

## Concepts Practiced

- Queue data structure
- Enqueue and dequeue operations
- While loops and conditionals
- Basic input/output

## Status

In Progress
